###Auto Dice Roller for Monopoly:

Let's create an automatic dice roller for a game of Monopoly!Fork this lab and use the monopoly.py file to write your script.

In Monopoly, at the beginning of each turn a player rolls two six sided dice. The numbers rolled on each die are added together to tell the player how many spaces to move. If the player rolls doubles, if they roll the same value on each die, then the player gets to move the total number of space, AND gets to roll again. Every time we run our monopoly dice app, it will tell us how many spaces we should move, and whether we have rolled doubles and get to go again, or whether it is the next player's turn.

The program should print a string that looks something like this if you roll doubles:

```python
Doubles! Move 6 spaces and roll again.
```
And if you don't roll doubles:
```python
Move 8 spaces. Next player's turn!
```
Remember to import your random library at the start of your script!
